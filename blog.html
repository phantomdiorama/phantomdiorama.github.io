<h2 id="hands"><a href="#hands">Hands</a></h2>
<p><strong>published on January 3, 2021</strong></p>
<p>There are two things that became obvious while attempting <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">NanoWriMo</a> in 2020. First, that procrastination and global crisis are the most intimate of lovers and, second, my hands are no longer capable of typing at a computer like they once were.</p>
<p>As some of you may know, I have Muscular Dystrophy, which is a muscle weakening condition. What this means is, among myriad other things, my hands have been slowly worsening over time. Think of how your hands look when holding a gamepad, now take the pad and imagine you can’t straighten your fingers out. Yep.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, I’ve gone from increasingly frequent typos—my twitter bio is now simply a warning of their presence—to actual pain. Sustained typing, and particularly chording, leads to cramping and pain in my fingers and across the knuckles. Because of this increasing pain, I had to ditch the computer partway through the first week of Nano and ended up tapping out the rest of the month’s word count on my phone. This had its own set of ergonomic problems. I got the 10,000 words I had planned. But something had to change.</p>
<h3 id="chords">Chords</h3>
<p>The first thing I looked into was alternative keyboard layouts. Perhaps there would be something more suitable to my circumstances than QWERTY. The <a href="https://blog.xkcd.com/2007/08/14/mirrorboard-a-one-handed-keyboard-layout-for-the-lazy/">Mirror Layout</a> looked interesting but is built around chording <code>capslock</code> with your pinky: in fact, more chords with your worst finger. More well known alternative layouts like <a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout">Dvorak</a> focus on touch typing, which I can’t do, and spread keys more evenly across both hands. Dvorak does have a modified left–hand–only version supposedly designed for those with hand injuries. Unfortunately, none of these reduce the amount of chords. This, along with the cognitive load of learning a different layout, made this route a dead end.</p>
<p>The stretching motion required to perform chords—especially those that include letters towards the centre of the keyboard—is the most fatiguing on my fingers so I want to avoid it as much as possible. Using the <code>alt</code> key to pull up a menu and arrowing around is certainly doable but it’s slow and pushes me towards using the mouse. What I really want is what my phone does. Shifting on the iOS keyboard is a toggle. But not just a toggle, one that auto-offs. When you hit <code>shift</code> it toggles on and waits for the next input, capitalises it, and turns shift off. Turns out Windows has a version of this in the form of StickyKeys. I say <em>has</em> in the sense that it’s a feature that exists. Unfortunately, I have never come across a more bug-riddled piece of software. What’s supposed to happen is StickyKeys turns the modifier keys (Alt, Control, Shift etc) into toggles so instead of pressing <code>control + x</code> to paste you press <code>control</code> <em>then</em> <code>x</code>. And it does. Then it suddenly decides not to. Or it works two out of three times. Or after restarting, one out of seven. Or sometimes the process would just die. What I’m saying is it sucks. I’m not sure if this is specific to my setup or not, but after a couple of frustrating days wrestling with it I gave up and <a href="https://github.com/phantomdiorama/unsuckykeys">made my own</a>. It’s a quick and dirty script but it seems to serve my purposes.</p>
<h3 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h3>
<p>My current keyboard is a fat old Corsair mechanical. I’ve had it for years and I love it. But my fingers no longer do. So I’ve been looking into other mechanicals in smaller sizes and while both 60% and 40% models would occupy less space on my desk they are still pretty heavy and they make up for their lack of keys with either layers or functions, in other words more chords. Like with the keyboard layouts, the benefits they may bring over my current setup are most likely eroded by new negatives. For now I’ve decided to swap out the Corsair with a generic plastic ‘board I found in a drawer. It has flat chiclet laptop-style keys with a low travel distance. I’m hoping it will put less stress on my fingers.</p>
<h3 id="vim">Vim</h3>
<p>While researching keyboard layouts and remapping I came across <a href="https://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/">Modern Space Cadet</a> by Steve Losh. In the post, Losh details how he went about creating a custom keymap. It’s long but well worth your time. And while Losh’s focus is programming, typing is typing and he has ideas there that I can steal. But the real reason I mention the post is because it acted, like many posts do, as a hypertext bread crumb trail and led to another of Losh’s posts on his <a href="https://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/">return to the text editor Vim</a>.</p>
<p>I had heard of Vim, of course, but I had written it off as too nerdy (yes, even for me), too esoteric, and the fetish for the home row made my hands sad. Vim is seen as an text editor only for programmers who can touch type and there seemed, to me at least, to be a air of elitism around it and some of its users. But as with all things, you should not judge an editor by its community.</p>
<p>I don’t know if Losh’s post was better written than others I had read or I just found it at the right time, but I <em>got</em> what Vim could do for me. By focusing first and foremost on “you can keep your hands on the home row yay” I think a lot of Vim fans are missing an substantial audience. For mine, coming to it new, Vim’s best feature is its deep customisation. This is doubly true for users with specific physical needs. Almost every key can be made to do something else or many things else. Coupled with minimal chording out of the box, Vim could well be what I’ve been looking for.</p>
<p>Vim reduces the reliance on chords by thinking of editing like writing sentences. For Losh, editing with Vim is like a language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have “verbs” and “nouns”. For example: the “change” command (c) would be a verb and the “word” item (w) is a noun. You can combine them to form sentences. The wonderful part about this is that whenever you learn a new verb (like “delete” (d)) you can immediately apply it to all the nouns you know</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the sentence “delete four words” becomes <code>d4w</code>. Want to change everything inside a set of parentheses? <code>ci(</code>. Of course this is the very tip of the Titanic-sized iceberg of what Vim can do.</p>
<p>Happily, if you’re writing fiction, as I am, you can get by without filling your head with key combos. You can get by with just: <code>d</code>elete, <code>y</code>ank (copy), <code>c</code>hange, and <code>p</code>ut (paste). In this first week I’ve relied on these four commands (as well as some help from the beginner guides <a href="http://therandymon.com/woodnotes/vim-for-writers/vimforwriters.html">here</a> and <a href="http://rc3.org/2012/05/12/the-grammar-of-vim/">here</a>) and things have been relatively smooth. Besides, you use all these commands in <strong>normal</strong> mode (think <em>editing</em> mode). Actual writing happens in <strong>insert</strong> mode and that remains the basically same as any other editor. Fans of modal editors like Vim believe splitting writing and editing into two separate tasks increases focus. At the very least, eliminating the stop–start of editing in situ <em>should</em> reduce the stress on my hands.</p>
<p>Yes, it sounds like Vim replaces stretching your hand into painful positions with a lot more key presses. And while I’ve found that to be true in my testing so far, that’s before I learned about the leader key. Vim’s leader key work like iOS’s shift toggle BUT can be made to do anything vim can with two keys. Want to find–and–replace cat for dog and then indent only the lines without the word fleas? You can. And you can map it to simply <code>leader + c</code>. Further, you can choose which key is the leader. I’ve set it as <code>space</code> so I can easily reach every other key to perform my custom mappings.</p>
<h3 id="what-now">What now?</h3>
<p>My plan now is to switch out the keyboards and attempt to use Vim full time for day–to–day writing, customising things when and if I need as I go. I’ll come back in a month or so with an update on whether my hands are better, worse, or the same, and if this has been an exercise in yak shaving.</p>

<p>As a younger man Ben could always catch himself, willing himself awake. As a younger man it didn't matter. He unspooled himself from the sheets stretched naked and cat-like, and padded into the bathroom. He caught himself in the mirror, his face dark with the morning, as he wiped himself off. He dropped the tissue and hit the flush.</p>
<p>He stood in the doorway and took in the bedroom in the pre-dawn haze: the slit of light from the hall, her clothes thrown over the back of a chair, his wife curled on her side away from him, cocooned in sheets. The darkness where he'd been</p>
<p>He flicked on the lamp and angled its bright arc away from the bed. A sigh hung in the air. He started to strip the bed, unlooping the fitted sheet from the corners of the mattress then moving to his wife's side. Changing the sheets. Go back to sleep. His voice breathed over her. He got to work. Unhooking the sheet and carefully scooping it out from under her legs. He fed the bedclothes out from under her, lifting her by her stomach then her bum with one hand and manoeuvring the sheets with the other. After gathering them up on his side, he saw it, painted across the kidneys of her nightshirt, the same darkness. Your PJs. He sighed in a loud whisper. He kneeled on the bed and tilted her upright. Arms up. He slid the shirt up and over her head, extracting first one and then the other arm. He added the shirt to the pile and scooped them up in a big white cloud and headed for the door. Hands full, he fought with the handle managing to creep it open. He turned back to the room. Got everything? His waking eyes settled on the bed, his wife curled and small on the bare mattress, each vertebrae protruding in a line that disappeared beneath her bra strap and into her underpants. The bed, and the day rising up around it.</p>
<p>He lumbered downstairs into the laundry. Dumping the sheets on the washer, unlatching the backdoor and letting the light bleed in through the security screen. He let the outside bathe his face and chest and the sound of the morning flush his ears. Just for a moment. He cracked open the porthole and fed the washer, the door shutting with a clunk. He stood, as the machine vibrated to life, with his hands on the angle of its corners, his palms pressed hard into their points. He stood straight-armed and tight shouldered, the rhythm of the off-centre load pulsing through him. He sunk to a crouch watching the sheets tumble and fold, the faded sunflower of her nightshirt pressed against the glass and was overcome. He crouched and watched. His face blank. Empty.</p>
<p>The cold of the bathroom stung Victoria, turning her freckled skin to gooseflesh. She stared at the walls of the dim blue room, her eyes tracing the twist in the fabric of the towels on the rack, the grout of the tile. She finished and dried and dropped the tissue between her legs, tethered together by the elastic at her knees. She yawned out the last of the night's sleep and pulled her hair up into a loose bun, the uncaught strands spilling out. She ran her hand across the small of her back, the skin tacky under her fingertips. She bit down on her lip and grabbed at the roll of tissue, spun it and tore off a length. She spiralled it around a hand and wiped him from her skin. She lifted a heavy arm over her shoulder, fingering for the button and hit the flush. Her other arm moved steadier, reaching out to pull the chair across the tiles. She sucked in all the air in the room, gathered herself, then, in one heavy awkward move twisted and straight-armed from the porcelain into the chair. The sudden cold of the plastic and metal biting into her skin. She man-handled her legs and feet into the stirrups, sucked back the tears from her eyes with a sniff and wheeled back into the bedroom.</p>
<p>The slits of light escaping the blinds of the huge box window faded up from white to yellow gold. She wheeled stiffly, castors sinking into the carpet, and cleared the rumpled clothes, his clothes, from the floor as she passed. Her eyes stung. The brakes snapped on and she slid stomach first onto the mattress, rolled onto her back and spread herself out, starfished. </p>
<p>Staring at the roof, tears pooled and burned her eyes.She was on her side, curled, when she heard him in the hall. She kept her eyes on the dresser, the watch, the stack of change, and stayed motionless when he slipped in behind her and he kissed the point of her shoulder. Was it about me? He entwined himself around her. Always. She closed her eyes tight and a hot wet tear escaped.</p>
