<p>It started with a <a
href="https://twitter.com/phantomdiorama/status/1316232565515190273?s=20">tweet</a>.
Which became a discussion. Then became a plan. We would write a book
together.</p>
<p>As you may know, this year my friend, Ciel, and I decided to attempt
to write a novel together. Neither of us have written a novel before.
And I haven’t co-written anything before. So we thought we should write
some kind of work log in case we forget how we did this thing (or anyone
ever asks about it). Here goes…</p>
<p>Very early on in our conversations we decided that I would do what we
named a spaghetti draft—essentially the bones of the story—on my own
before coming together to Make It Good.</p>

<p>So that’s what I’ve been doing. I would write during the day and at
night I’d slide into Ciel’s DMs with that day’s words, she’d say ‘Yes.
Good.’ and we’d move on. We tried not to over–discuss this early work:
mostly just what we liked (<em>‘Cat’ - Ciel</em>), what worked or
didn’t, or which direction we should take (<em>‘More cat’ - Ciel</em>).
We talked mostly about big picture. The theme of the book. How the
characters of the town would interact with each other. How to write a
story where people are mostly nice to each other <em>and</em> how to
make that interesting. About which pot plants would fit in a
backpack.</p>
<p>We gave ourselves (well, me) six months to complete this early draft.
We finished on August 1st with around 31,000 words. Obviously, this is
only the first step (and first blog post) of many.</p>
<p>The next step is taking a deserved fortnight break and reading over
our (actual physical sliced-tree) copies. Then comes the <a
