		<h2>Evidence</h2>
			<p> As a younger man Ben could always catch himself, willing himself awake. As a younger man it didn't matter. He unspooled himself from the sheets stretched naked and cat-like, and padded into the bathroom. He caught himself in the mirror, his face dark with the morning, as he wiped himself off. He dropped the tissue and hit the flush.</p>
			<p>He stood in the doorway and took in the bedroom in the pre-dawn haze: the slit of light from the hall, her clothes thrown over the back of a chair, his wife curled on her side away from him, cocooned in sheets. The darkness where he'd been</p>
			<p>He flicked on the lamp and angled its bright arc away from the bed. A sigh hung in the air. He started to strip the bed, unlooping the fitted sheet from the corners of the mattress then moving to his wife's side. Changing the sheets. Go back to sleep. His voice breathed over her. He got to work. Unhooking the sheet and carefully scooping it out from under her legs. He fed the bedclothes out from under her, lifting her by her stomach then her bum with one hand and maneuvering the sheets with the other. After gathering them up on his side, he saw it, painted across the kidneys of her nightshirt, the same darkness. Your PJs. He sighed in a loud whisper. He kneeled on the bed and tilted her upright. Arms up. He slid the shirt up and over her head, extracting first one and then the other arm. He added the shirt to the pile and scooped them up in a big white cloud and headed for the door. Hands full, he fought with the handle managing to creep it open. He turned back to the room. Got everything? His waking eyes settled on the bed, his wife curled and small on the bare mattress, each vertebrae protruding in a line that disappeared beneath her bra strap and into her underpants. The bed, and the day rising up around it.</p>
			<p>He lumbered downstairs into the laundry. Dumping the sheets on the washer, unlatching the backdoor and letting the light bleed in through the security screen. He let the outside bathe his face and chest and the sound of the morning flush his ears. Just for a moment. He cracked open the porthole and fed the washer, the door shutting with a clunk. He stood, as the machine vibrated to life, with his hands on the angle of its corners, his palms pressed hard into their points. He stood straight-armed and tight shouldered, the rhythm of the off-centre load pulsing through him. He sunk to a crouch watching the sheets tumble and fold, the faded sunflower of her nightshirt pressed against the glass and was overcome. He crouched and watched. His face blank. Empty.</p>

			<p>The cold of the bathroom stung Victoria, turning her freckled skin to gooseflesh. She stared at the walls of the dim blue room, her eyes tracing the twist in the fabric of the towels on the rack, the grout of the tile. She finished and dried and dropped the tissue between her legs, tethered together by the elastic at her knees. She yawned out the last of the night's sleep and pulled her hair up into a loose bun, the uncaught strands spilling out. She ran her hand across the small of her back, the skin tacky under her fingertips. She bit down on her lip and grabbed at the roll of tissue, spun it and tore off a length. She spiralled it around a hand and wiped him from her skin. She lifted a heavy arm over her shoulder, fingering for the button and hit the flush. Her other arm moved steadier, reaching out to pull the chair across the tiles. She sucked in all the air in the room, gathered herself, then, in one heavy awkward move twisted and straight-armed from the porcelain into the chair. The sudden cold of the plastic and metal biting into her skin. She man-handled her legs and feet into the stirrups, sucked back the tears from her eyes with a sniff and wheeled back into the bedroom.</p>
			<p>The slits of light escaping the blinds of the huge box window faded up from white to yellow gold. She wheeled stiffly, castors sinking into the carpet, and cleared the rumpled clothes, his clothes, from the floor as she passed. Her eyes stung. The brakes snapped on and she slid stomach first onto the mattress, rolled onto her back and spread herself out, starfished. </p>
			<p>Staring at the roof, tears pooled and burned her eyes.She was on her side, curled, when she heard him in the hall. She kept her eyes on the dresser, the watch, the stack of change, and stayed motionless when he slipped in behind her and he kissed the point of her shoulder. Was it about me? He entwined himself around her. Always. She closed her eyes tight and a hot wet tear escaped.</p>
