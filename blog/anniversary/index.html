  <p>Been dealing with an annoying health issue, as I always am, but despite
this things have been surprisingly busy. Ciel and I have just celebrated
our six month wedding anniversary so we‚Äôve been husbanding up a storm.
We‚Äôre really killing it as a married couple.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre also waist-deep in the preliminaries of IVF with the tests and the
money and the waiting and the money. We did our psychologist appointments,
which are a legal requirement here in Australia. And now everything is in
place to start sometime before the end of the year. Speaking of things I‚Äôm
mentally preparing for, I‚Äôm turning 40 in a few weeks, which is it‚Äôs own
bundle of brain-itches.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs also been a bunch of activity on the book with lots of tweaks and
ideas for tweaks. We‚Äôve been working on a new opening and I‚Äôm happier with
where we‚Äôre heading.</p>
<h2 id="watching">watching</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve just finished <em>Guy Montgomery&rsquo;s Guy Mont Spelling Bee</em>. I‚Äôm a sucker
for quiz and panel shows and I love the retro vibes and Micallef-esque
wordplay. Also binged my way through <em>The Inbestigators</em> which is my
favourite show of the year (it actually came out a couple years back).
It‚Äôs kids running a detective agency. Very funny and very Australian. It‚Äôs
from the folks at Gristmill, who always make quality stuff.</p>
<p>Both shows available on iView. Inbestigators is also on Netflix.</p>
<h2 id="listening">listening</h2>
<p>Kevin Smith and his daughter have a new podcast called <em>Beardless,
D*ckless Me</em>. If you‚Äôre familiar with Smith, it‚Äôs as profane as you‚Äôd
expect (ie very). But their relationship is incredibly loving with a lot
pride and respect and good humour flowing between the two. And the
callbacks often genuinely make me laugh out out. It‚Äôs a nice energy to
have pushed into your brain.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a podcast. Get it from the podcast getting place.</p>
<h2 id="using">using</h2>
<p>A new section! A place to mention a new <em>thing</em> I‚Äôve discovered. Might be
software or a gadget. Or something to fill the page when I haven‚Äôt been
reading anything. You decide.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/">vidir</a>, which I found via <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/04/12/a-list-of-new-ish--command-line-tools/">Julia Evans</a>, lets you rename a
directory of files in your text editor. So you can use find and replace on
a bunch filenames. Or use regex. Doesn‚Äôt sound like much but if you ever
had fix a bunch of files with awful formatting (snake_case üêç) or you need
to change a word <em>in the middle</em> of a filename, you‚Äôll know how useful
this is.</p>
