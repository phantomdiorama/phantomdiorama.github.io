White Room Syndrome is the habit of creating a scenes that are so
under-described, so lacking detail that it could be taking place in a
featureless white-walled room in anywhere in the world. There is no sense
of place. And the characters are doing their stuff in an empty void as if
they’ve walked out of the picture like Daffy Duck in Duck Amuck.
Obviously, scenes without specific, concrete locations are to be avoided

the other extreme when fleshing out the story." />

  <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about scene description while attempting to write
this book (yes that’s still happening). The question of how much scene
setting is necessary? How much is enough? What’s too much? Too little? How
many words are the difference between a scene that’s skeletal and one
that’s chonky?</p>
<p>White Room Syndrome is the habit of creating a scenes that are so
under-described, so lacking detail that it could be taking place in a
featureless white-walled room in anywhere in the world. There is no sense
of place. And the characters are doing their stuff in an empty void as if
they’ve walked out of the picture like Daffy Duck in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvXsuSJ-1A">Duck Amuck</a>.
Obviously, scenes without specific, concrete locations are to be avoided
like the plague (assuming people actually avoid plagues anymore). But, as
a chronic under-writer, looking at thin scenes, it’s hard to not swing to
the other extreme when fleshing out the story.</p>
<p>The question of how much as been floating in the soup I call my brain as
I’ve been reading the last book in Cormac McCarthy’s border trilogy,
<em>Cities of the Plain</em>. McCarthy is rightful lauded for his long, lyrical
descriptions of landscapes. And <em>Cities</em> is no different. Whenever his
characters are on horseback, which given it’s a western is most of the
time, we get beautiful descriptions of everything from the grass at the
horse’s feet, to the scrub-life of the country, to the air, to every
feature of the landscape from where the characters sat their horses to the
horizon. And the sky. So much about the sky. Its bruised purple colour and
its clouds mounting at the edge of the world. How it’s only connection to
the earth is the tendrils of lightning that silently strike the dark shape
of a distant mesa. Someone much braver than me might suggest that McCarthy
possibly drifts into <em>too much</em> territory.</p>
<p>However, McCarthy doesn’t always feel the need to flex his considerable
descriptive muscles. At one point, partway through <em>Cities</em>, the
protagonist John Grady waits for a girl at a hotel. The only details we’re
given about the room is it has a window that looks out onto the street and
a door. Yet this scene is as alive as any other. The context of the scene
determines the amount of description we’re given. The room’s furnishings
are irrelevant to the man pacing its floor. What the window and door look
like doesn’t matter, when he’s constantly checking them. The communal
kitchen used by John Grady and the other ranch hands that appears
throughout the book is similarly sparsely described. A table and a stove.
The amount of words used to set the scene is decided by what the reader
knows and what they need to know. Which I guess is an obvious way of going
about things when you think about it. Why would you waste words describing
things people know? We know what a hotel room looks like. In <em>No Country
for Old Men</em>, another McCarthy book, the rural police station the
handcuffed Chigurh is taken to isn’t described at all. In fact, we only
find out it’s rural via the officer’s dialogue. We know what the police
station looks like. From countless other books and movies and television.
Not IRL. Obviously.</p>
<p>All of this to come to the realisation that context of the scene is
<em>everything</em>. Which, if not the summit of Duh Mountain, is at the very
least basecamp.</p>
<p>I guess a good scene, then, is one that provides enough detail to ground
characters within a specific world, but  doesn’t author-splain to readers
what they already know. Of course, this is just musings, I’m sure actual
advice is floating around elsewhere on the internet like low clouds
limping soundlessly across the star-pricked firmament.</p>
<p>So, for this book we’re writing (ostensibly the point of this blog), I’m
going to focus less on adding flesh to the scenes at the school or the
soccer field and more on the ones with houseplants flying through the air.</p>
