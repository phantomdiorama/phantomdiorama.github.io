<meta name="description" content="So the experiment failed. Sort of. Last time I talked about changing to
vim in an effort to save my hands. Text entry of course ended up the same
and I could keep hitting my (paltry) word counts. But when editing, well,
there are too many commands to hold in my head, and most of my editing
time was spent consulting the cheat sheet on my desk. Editing became
wading through sticky molasses. Had I stuck with it perhaps this need
would lessen over time. Also, I kept falling back on using the mouse which
is very much frowned on in vim circles. BUT it turns out my hands
require the relief that comes with stopping and moving to the electric
rodent." />

  <p>So the experiment failed. Sort of. <a href="2021-01-03.html">Last time</a> I talked about changing to
vim in an effort to save my hands. Text entry of course ended up the same
and I could keep hitting my (paltry) word counts. But when editing, well,
there are too many commands to hold in my head, and most of my editing
time was spent consulting the cheat sheet on my desk. Editing became
wading through sticky molasses. Had I stuck with it perhaps this need
would lessen over time. Also, I kept falling back on using the mouse which
is very much frowned on in vim circles. BUT it turns out my hands
<em>require</em> the relief that comes with stopping and moving to the electric
rodent.</p>
<p>It was not all wasted effort though. The separation of writing and editing
into distinct contexts is something I plan to continue in future. And
learning <a href="https://github.com/ziishaned/learn-regex">Regular Expressions</a> will be invaluable when doing a complicated
search and replace task.</p>
<p>Other parts of last month’s change-up have been more successful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/phantomdiorama/unsuckykeys">unsucky keys</a>, the no-chording script I wrote is still in everyday use.
There are bugs and edge-cases, but it works well and stable enough to
stay out of the way</li>
<li>Changing keyboards was the main positive this past month. The one I
found in the drawer was a non-starter. Literally. The keys didn’t work.
So, I purchased a Raspberry Pi keyboard and it’s become my daily driver.
It’s sturdy for the price, has a USB hub, and the money goes to support
the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/about">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a>. I had to remap a couple keys to make my
hands happy, but it has made a genuinely big difference to comfort and pains levels.</li>
