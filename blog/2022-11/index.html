<p>For the last few weeks my part of the world has been submerged under water. There’s been sandbagging and phones pinging warnings and evacuation orders and helicopters going back and forth overhead. While our street remained dry—they put in a flood wall after the last major flood in the 90s but it had been untested until now—the south side of the river wasn’t as lucky and many homes are still under water and many others were damaged. This has all been <em>not great</em> for someone with an anxiety disorder. And writing went out the window. Which was closed. Because of the flood.</p>
<p>I’ve also just had a birthday which usually brings with it a bit of a slump. But this year I’ve been distracted by the water and deciding which order to eat the Cadbury Favourites in. Also I got some heckin’ <a href="https://twitter.com/phantomdiorama/status/1589438466173308928?s=46&amp;t=zzLdmpJAAWeTmi364IEvRg">flowers</a></p>
<h2 id="reading">reading</h2>
<p>My brain had little room for fiction writing and even less for fiction reading. So I’m still somewhere in the middle of the Percy Jackson book I talked about last time.</p>
<p>I liked <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/afterword/the-deer-who-lived-upstairs">The Deer Who Lived Upstairs</a> by Susan Orlean in The New Yorker. Her essays always have a gentleness to them.</p>
<h2 id="watching">watching</h2>
<p>Spent a lot of time on the River Data website, watching the numbers tick upwards. I’m close to finishing the second season of Good With Wood. There’s something very wholesome about these kind of competition shows from the UK. I’m also trying to catch up on Bob’s Burgers. I’m pretty far behind and I still need to watch the movie. And the new season just appeared on Disney.</p>
