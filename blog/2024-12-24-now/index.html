  <p>The wheels have fallen off as we trudge toward the end of the year. Last
month was met with a short, sharp, fall-through-the-floor depressive
episode. These aren’t new for me. I can normally feel them coming, like
thunderheads sliding over the ocean, but there’s no guessing the length or
depth. It was a bad one. That it happened around my birthday, when I turned
into a forty-year-old man, is obviously a coincidence.</p>
<p>At the end of the month, our IVF cycle didn’t work and&hellip; it&rsquo;s been
hard. It’s not so much a feeling of emptiness but of being emptied. Of
something being removed. Ciel and I will spend the holiday break in the
quiet and regroup as much as we can. With a hope for better things in
2025.</p>
<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>
<p>When I’ve been able to, I’ve been catching up on Doctor Who. I had bounced
off it hard from fatigue somewhere in the Smith era, but ABC Family
recently started re-airing old episodes and I’ve been sucked back in. I
have now seen all of Eleven and, as of this weekend, all of Twelve. I
think Capaldi’s Doctor is the most human the character has been. At least
since the reboot. And that makes him the most interesting. And Clara more
interesting too. Will keep watching, cautiously, but doubt those three
seasons will be bettered.</p>
