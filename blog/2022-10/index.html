<p>So far most of the work on our novel has been done over the internet, over distance, and asynchronously—each working when our brains felt capable. And that hasn’t been hard. The majority of our relationship happens over long distance so we’re used to that. And adding writing to that wasn’t too much of an ask.
Actually, I was unsure how working in the same room would go. But sitting at the <a href="https://twitter.com/agapanthusfran/status/1573859543570063361?s=46&amp;t=UhzpzscVeTj-_yvdnctvFw">same desk</a> and being able to simply point at things bought back the bounce and flow and <em>fun</em> that I didn’t realise had dissipated lately. So we’re excited again and the soft deadline of Christmas (2022) seems accomplishable (it’s a word).</p>

<p>Other than writing, I’ve been working a couple smaller projects. Over the last little while I’ve been putting together a <a href="https://github.com/phantomdiorama/writingvim">collection of links</a> for using Vim for fiction slash general prose. I’m hoping it will be a useful resource for beginners, like me, or at least <em>someone</em>. This is part of my ongoing wrangling with that text editor. And because collecting links will be an continuing thing, I’ve made work for Future Mike which I’m sure he’ll be happy about.
Relatedly, I’ve been poking at a colorscheme for Vim inspired by Bob’s Burgers palette. It’s called <a href="https://github.com/phantomdiorama/nopesto">No Pesto</a>. For obvious reasons. This was harder than I expected. For a task many people have completed there’s a baffling lack of detailed docs. I’m letting this be perpetually work-in-progress.</p>
<h2 id="reading">reading</h2>
<p>I got burnt out on <em>Ripley Underground</em> and needed something different. And like the saying goes the opposite of Patricia Highsmith is Rick Riordan. So I’ve been making my way through the Percy Jackson series. I’m about halfway through book two, <em>The Sea of Monsters</em>,  and I’m enjoying it. The series is in first-person which doesn’t always gel with me but Percy isn’t <em>too</em> annoying. Also got the just-released <em>A Kind of Magic</em> by Anna Spargo-Ryan. But it will sit on the stack until I’m emotionally ready for it.</p>
<h2 id="watching">watching</h2>
<p>I think <em>No Time to Die</em> is probably the best of the Craig Bonds. It was more emotional than usual for a Bond but it was genuine and wasn’t out of place. Kinda hoping it’s the end of <em>serious</em> Bond for now though and they bring back some Roger Moore style wackiness with the next guy. Also saw <em>Coco</em> which is a bit darker (spoiler- there is a murder) than most Pixar fare. I loved it.</p>
<h2 id="listening">listening</h2>
<p>Almost caught up on my backlog of Richard Herring’s podcast. Just finished the one with Omid Djalili. It’s light and funny and inoffensive (to the ears) when I’m doing something else. And, because I’m writing more, and I’m a big nerd, that means <em>Thelonious Monk Alone in San Francisco</em> on repeat. Did you know his middle name was Sphere?</p>
