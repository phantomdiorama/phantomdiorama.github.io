<p><strong>Desktop (2020):</strong> Ryzen 3200G, 8GB RAM, SSD. I had my previous desktop for a little more than a decade so this is a pretty big upgrade in terms of speed and hardware stability. This was a present to myself after finishing uni.</p>
<p><strong>HP 250 G6 (2018):</strong> Intel i5, 4GB RAM, SSD. Current laptop. Only gets occasional use lately.</p>
<p><strong>Raspberry Pi Keyboard:</strong> See above. Cheap and works as a USB hub.</p>
<p><strong>Roccat Kone AIMO:</strong> Nice mouse. lots of clicky buttons and RGB if you like that sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>iPod Touch (7th Gen):</strong> An iPhone without the phone, in other words: perfect. Use this for twitter and writing in bed.</p>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p><strong>Windows 10:</strong> Previous desktop OS was Win 7. This is like a slightly worse version of that. Works fine.</p>
<p><strong>Ubuntu 20.04:</strong> The Win 10 install on the laptop died from neglect, so now there’s this. It’s reasonably fast and works similarly enough to Windows. Has a bug where it locks up on shutdown which I should fix at some point.</p>
<p><strong>Notepad++:</strong> Where the majority of writing happens. Rock solid.</p>
<p><strong>Word/Scrivener/1Writer:</strong> Various writing tools. Scrivener is nice, but I haven’t dived into it too deeply. Word is sadly a necessity. On iOS, 1Writer is the best text editor and I’ve tried them all.</p>
<p><strong>Dropbox:</strong> For backup and sync. Only way I’ve found to reliably sync between iOS and Windows. Also use <em>File History</em> and <em>rclone</em> for various backup purposes.</p>
<p><strong>zola:</strong> For building this website. Nice and simple.</p>
