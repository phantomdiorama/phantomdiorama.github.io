<meta name="description" content="An announcement and an apology.
Last month I got married. Surprisingly, given who I am as a person I was
not anxious on the day, even when there was worry it would rain. I almost
burst into hot tears the moment I saw Ceil in their dress and then again
in the car, but I managed to keep it together for the ceremony. I was
completely calm saying those words in front of people. It was a amazing
day and even though it was overcast the gardens where we had ceremony were
stunning. If you follow me on social media you will have already been
bombarded with photos. And videos. Ciel has wonderfully documented the
whole thing on Youtube. Needless
to say but I’m saying it anyway, we are disgustingly happy and looking
forward to many, many adventures together." />

  <p>An announcement and an apology.</p>
<p>Last month I got married. Surprisingly, given who I am as a person I was
not anxious on the day, even when there was worry it would rain. I almost
burst into hot tears the moment I saw Ceil in their dress and then again
in the car, but I managed to keep it together for the ceremony. I was
completely calm saying those words in front of people. It was a amazing
day and even though it was overcast the gardens where we had ceremony were
stunning. If you follow me on social media you will have already been
bombarded with photos. And videos. Ciel has wonderfully documented the
whole thing on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TaciturnMiss">Youtube</a>. Needless
to say but I’m saying it anyway, we are disgustingly happy and looking
forward to many, many adventures together.</p>
<p>To anyone looking for a boyfriend, girlfriend, best friend and/or someone
to marry, I am sorry. I got the best one. I don’t know <em>how</em> I did it. Or
why I am so lucky. But I did it. And I plan on keeping them. So you’ll
just have to make do.</p>
