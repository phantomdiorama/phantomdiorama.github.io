  <p>Two weeks before Christmas is a good time for the second post of the year!</p>
<p>It’s been a bumpy one. But the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_latitudes">horse
latitudes</a> of 2025 are now
mostly behind us and we’re looking toward something brighter. In the new year,
Ciel starts a new role better suited to his many talents. Better for brain and
body. For me, the plan is to start getting out there with my writing. Pitching
to places and entering competitions and all that anxiety-inducing stuff. Good
anxiety. Which I’ve been told is a thing.</p>
<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>
<p>Last weekend I finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterious_Benedict_Society_(TV_series)">The Mysterious Benedict
Society</a>.
The writing was the main draw for me. The four kids are smart, anxious in a way
I haven’t really seen before, and they are refreshingly treated as capable by
the adults around them. It’s also has a cool Wes Anderson-ish visual style. And
there’s also Kristen Schaal, and Tony Hale playing twins. Of course, like all
good shows produced for streaming, it’s been cancelled. But at least it doesn’t
end on a cliffhanger. It’s on
<a href="https://iview.abc.net.au/show/mysterious-benedict-society">iView</a> here in
Australia.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Bafflingly it’s been scrubbed from Disney+. So watch it wherever you
can, I guess.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>Just a couple books from the near-toppling TBR pile. <em>Little Women</em> and <em>Little
Men</em> by Louisa May Alcott graduated to <a href="https://www.michaelbuckleywriter.com/reading/">The List</a>. Continuing with the
books I somehow haven’t read, this morning I started on Treasure Island. I
think it’s about pirates.</p>
<p>There was also this excellent article about a music festival setup to support
Native American youth mental health, <a href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/57-11/heavy-metal-is-healing-teens-on-the-blackfeet-nation/">Heavy Metal Healing On The Blackfeet
Nation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="using">Using</h2>
<p>At the start of the year, I thought it would be a good idea to organise and
convert my CD collection to mp3. So far, after organising and culling (and
donating) and ripping these past months, I’ve done&hellip; exactly half. Anyway,
I’ve been using the perfectly-named <a href="https://abcde.einval.com/wiki/">abcde</a> for
ripping and <a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/">Picard</a> for tagging. They are
nerdy and work well. Just like me. The first part anyway.</p>
