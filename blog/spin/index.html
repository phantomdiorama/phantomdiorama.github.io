And records—I cannot say &lsquo;vinyl&rsquo;—are the most physical of the physical media. They are big and heavy. They take up space. Because of this and a general lack of money my collection will always remain small, with just enough space for specific albums I know and love. I will list them here (the songs in <em>italics</em> are personal favs):</p>
<h3 id="beth-gibbons--rustin-man---out-of-season">Beth Gibbons &amp; Rustin Man - Out Of Season</h3>
<p>I first saw the video for Tom the Model on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(TV_program)">Rage</a> in the early 2000s. Although it obviously sounded like Portishead, I didn’t make the connection until much later. &lsquo;Tom&rsquo; is the most Portishead-y track on the album though. The rest is folkier. With more daylight. Tinged with Nina Simone. <em>Mysteries, Funny Time Of Year.</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_Season_(Beth_Gibbons_and_Rustin_Man_album)">Wikipedia</a></p>
<h3 id="bob-dylan---oh-mercy">Bob Dylan - Oh Mercy</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Most of the time I wouldn&rsquo;t change it if I could.&rsquo; I’m probably one of the few people that prefers Dylan’s later work—although it is a little brain-melty to think of an album from 1989 as late work. Personal nostalgia is difficult to pull off well and few can stand with Dylan, except maybe Leonard Cohen. Or Joni Mitchell. And even then, only at their best.  <em>Everything Is Broken, Most Of The Time.</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Mercy">Wikipedia</a></p>
<h3 id="bob-dylan---rough--rowdy-ways">Bob Dylan - Rough &amp; Rowdy Ways</h3>
<p>An old American God recounts a disappearing century. A kind of public nostalgia. First Dylan album in ten years and maybe the only good to come out of Covid&rsquo;s bad. <em>False Prophet, Murder Most Foul</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_and_Rowdy_Ways">Wikipedia</a></p>
<h3 id="frank-sinatra---in-the-wee-small-hours">Frank Sinatra - In The Wee Small Hours</h3>
<p>Supposedly the very first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_album">Concept album</a>. Reminds me of stumbling home from some fancy party, cotton-mouthed from cigarettes and whiskey, bowtie loose at my neck. OK that never happened. But the music is nice. Night-time distilled down and etched onto plastic. <em>Mood Indigo, I Get Along Without You Very Well.</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Wee_Small_Hours">Wikipedia</a></p>
<h3 id="massive-attack---mezzanine">Massive Attack - Mezzanine</h3>
<p>Probably most famous for Teardrop—the video with baby singing in the womb. Which then became the theme for the show House. The building thrum of Angel is perhaps an all time album opener. Sadly, the album is somewhat top-heavy—the singles make up the first four songs, and while they are excellent, the second disc is less memorable. <em>Angel, Dissolved Girl.</em>.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezzanine_(album)">Wikipedia</a></p>
<h3 id="nick-cave---idiot-prayer">Nick Cave - Idiot Prayer</h3>
<p>OK <em>this</em> may be the good to come out of Covid&rsquo;s bad. Just Nick, a piano and a big empty room. Yes, it&rsquo;s re-arrangements of old songs. Yet it&rsquo;s a perfect companion for a world that aches as ours does now. <em>Nobody&rsquo;s Baby Now, Brompton Oratory.</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiot_Prayer">Wikipedia</a></p>
<h3 id="pink-floyd---meddle">Pink Floyd - Meddle</h3>
<p>Nick Mason singing &lsquo;one of these days I&rsquo;m going to cut you into little pieces&rsquo; sounds a Geiger–counter. And together with the driving bass-line makes for one of the most apocalyptic singles ever released. Side two’s calming Echoes has often been my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro</a> timer. No-one needs to hear Seamus. <em>Fearless, Echoes.</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meddle">Wikipedia</a></p>
<h3 id="portishead---roseland-nyc">Portishead - Roseland NYC</h3>
<p>If In The Wee Small Hours is the sound of a night done well, Roseland is a night gone askew. It’s a ballroom seen through the bottom of a glass. Basically a Best-Of. But with a warmth from the live strings. <em>All Mine, Over.</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseland_NYC_Live">Wikipedia</a></p>
