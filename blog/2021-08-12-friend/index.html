  <p><em>It started with a tweet</em></p>
<p><em>Which became a discussion</em></p>
<p><em>Then became a plan</em></p>
<p><em>We would write a book together</em></p>
<p>As you may know, this year my friend, Ciel, and I decided to attempt to
write a novel together. Neither of us have written a novel before. And I
haven’t co-written anything before. So we thought we should write some
kind of work log in case we forget how we did this thing (or anyone ever
asks about it). Here goes&hellip;</p>
<p>Very early on in our conversations we decided that I would do what we
named a spaghetti draft—essentially the bones of the story—on my own
before coming together to Make It Good.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tweet.png" alt="" title="The Tweet"></p>
<p>So that’s what I’ve been doing. I would write during the day and at night
I’d slide into Ciel’s DMs with that day’s words, she’d say ‘Yes. Good.’
and we’d move on. We tried not to over–discuss this early work: mostly
just what we liked (<em>‘Cat’ - Ciel</em>), what worked or didn’t, or which
direction we should take (<em>‘More cat’ - Ciel</em>). We talked mostly about big
picture. The theme of the book. How the characters of the town would
interact with each other. How to write a story where people are mostly
nice to each other <em>and</em> how to make that interesting. About which pot
plants would fit in a backpack.</p>
<p>We gave ourselves (well, me) six months to complete this early draft. We
finished on August 1st with around 31,000 words. Obviously, this is only
the first step (and first blog post) of many.</p>
<p>The next step is taking a deserved fortnight break and reading over our
(actual physical sliced-tree) copies. Then comes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubberducking</a>.</p>
<p>(<em>‘This post needs more cat’ - Ciel</em>)</p>
