It’s a lovely thing to be busy with, however it has left little

taken the backseat. Which is fine. But I’m looking forward to getting back
into it now most things have settled into place.

to add or rewrite. We’ve found a new character who is demanding to be
included. This written–during–pandemic book is taking up a lot of the

  <p>So far this year has been taken up with planning for the upcoming wedding.
It’s a lovely thing to be busy with, however it has left little
brain–space for anything else. Writing—both <em>real</em> and this blog—have
taken the backseat. Which is fine. But I’m looking forward to getting back
into it now most things have settled into place.</p>
<p>There is a lot of work to be done on The Book: Copy–editing to do. Scenes
to add or rewrite. We’ve found a new character who is demanding to be
included. This written–during–pandemic book is taking up <em>a lot</em> of the
post–pandemic.</p>
<p>We will get there.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>Reading is the hobby I’ve been neglecting the most. My TBR list is so long
the screensaver on my kindle is now the disappointed face of my mother.</p>
<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>
<p>Somehow I’ve been watching a lot of Basketball on Sundays. I don’t know if
I’d say I’m super into it, and I don’t follow a specific team, but it’s
nice to have the anticipation for it during the week. It’s easy to forget
that’s how it was for all television—waiting a week for the next episode
of Friends or The X-Files.</p>
