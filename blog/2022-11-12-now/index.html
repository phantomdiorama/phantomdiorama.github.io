  <p>For the last few weeks my part of the world has been submerged under
water. There’s been sandbagging and phones pinging warnings and evacuation
orders and helicopters going back and forth overhead. While our street
remained dry—they put in a flood wall after the last major flood in the
90s but it had been untested until now—the south side of the river wasn’t
as lucky and many homes are still under water and many others were
damaged. This has all been <em>not great</em> for someone with an anxiety
disorder. And writing went out the window. Which was closed. Because of
the flood.</p>
<p>I’ve also just had a birthday which usually brings with it a bit of a
slump. But this year I’ve been distracted by the water and deciding which
order to eat the Cadbury Favourites in. Also I got some heckin’
<a href="https://twitter.com/phantomdiorama/status/1589438466173308928?s=46&amp;t=zzLdmpJAAWeTmi364IEvRg">flowers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>My brain had little room for fiction writing and even less for fiction
reading. So I’m still somewhere in the middle of the Percy Jackson book I
talked about last time.</p>
<p>I liked <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/afterword/the-deer-who-lived-upstairs">The Deer Who Lived Upstairs</a> by Susan Orlean in The New Yorker.
Her essays always have a gentleness to them.</p>
<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>
<p>Spent a lot of time on the River Data website, watching the numbers tick
upwards. I’m close to finishing the second season of Good With Wood.
There’s something very wholesome about these kind of competition shows
from the UK. I’m also trying to catch up on Bob’s Burgers. I’m pretty far
behind and I still need to watch the movie. And the new season just
appeared on Disney.</p>
