<meta name="description" content="Writing with another person can be a wonderful experience. Turns out
that’s even more true when you’re actually sitting beside your co-author.
And not just because they smell nice. I’m writing with my fiancé so that
last part isn’t weird.
So far most of the work on our novel has been done over the internet, over
distance, and asynchronously—each working when our brains felt capable.
And that hasn’t been hard. The majority of our relationship happens over
long distance so we’re used to that. And adding writing to that wasn’t too
much of an ask.  Actually, I was unsure how working in the same room would
go. But sitting at the same desk and being able to simply point at
things bought back the bounce and flow and fun that I didn’t realise had
dissipated lately. So we’re excited again and the soft deadline of
Christmas (2022) seems accomplishable (it’s a word)." />

  <p>Writing with another person can be a wonderful experience. Turns out
that’s even more true when you’re actually sitting beside your co-author.
And not just because they smell nice. I’m writing with my fiancé so that
last part isn’t weird.</p>
<p>So far most of the work on our novel has been done over the internet, over
distance, and asynchronously—each working when our brains felt capable.
And that hasn’t been hard. The majority of our relationship happens over
long distance so we’re used to that. And adding writing to that wasn’t too
much of an ask.  Actually, I was unsure how working in the same room would
go. But sitting at the <a href="https://twitter.com/agapanthusfran/status/1573859543570063361?s=46&amp;t=UhzpzscVeTj-_yvdnctvFw">same desk</a> and being able to simply point at
things bought back the bounce and flow and <em>fun</em> that I didn’t realise had
dissipated lately. So we’re excited again and the soft deadline of
Christmas (2022) seems accomplishable (it’s a word).</p>
<p>Other than writing, I’ve been working a couple smaller projects. Over the
last little while I’ve been putting together a <a href="https://github.com/phantomdiorama/writingvim">collection of links</a> for
using Vim for fiction slash general prose. I’m hoping it will be a useful
resource for beginners, like me, or at least <em>someone</em>. This is part of my
ongoing wrangling with that text editor. And because collecting links will
be an continuing thing, I’ve made work for Future Mike which I’m sure
he’ll be happy about.  Relatedly, I’ve been poking at a colorscheme for
Vim inspired by Bob’s Burgers palette. It’s called <a href="https://github.com/phantomdiorama/nopesto">No Pesto</a>. For obvious
reasons. This was harder than I expected. For a task many people have
completed there’s a baffling lack of detailed docs. I’m letting this be
perpetually work-in-progress.</p>
<h2 id="reading">reading</h2>
<p>I got burnt out on <em>Ripley Underground</em> and needed something different.
And like the saying goes the opposite of Patricia Highsmith is Rick
Riordan. So I’ve been making my way through the Percy Jackson series. I’m
about halfway through book two, <em>The Sea of Monsters</em>,  and I’m enjoying
it. The series is in first-person which doesn’t always gel with me but
Percy isn’t <em>too</em> annoying.</p>
<h2 id="watching">watching</h2>
<p>I think <em>No Time to Die</em> is probably the best of the Craig Bonds. It was
more emotional than usual for a Bond but it was genuine and wasn’t out of
place. Kinda hoping it’s the end of <em>serious</em> Bond for now though and they
bring back some Roger Moore style wackiness with the next guy. Also saw
<em>Coco</em> which is a bit darker (spoiler- there is a murder) than most Pixar
fare. I loved it.</p>
<h2 id="listening">listening</h2>
<p>Almost caught up on my backlog of Richard Herring’s podcast. Just finished
the one with Omid Djalili. It’s light and funny and inoffensive (to the
ears) when I’m doing something else. And, because I’m writing more, and
I’m a big nerd, that means <em>Thelonious Monk Alone in San Francisco</em> on
repeat. Did you know his middle name was Sphere?</p>
