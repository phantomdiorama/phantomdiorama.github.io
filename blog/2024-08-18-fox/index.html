  <p>My eyes aren&rsquo;t what they used to be. A bog witch hasn&rsquo;t turned them into
tiny owls&ndash;they are still eyes. But they are becoming less good at <em>being</em>
eyes.</p>
<p>Glasses may be in my future, but for now the issue is text. I can read
books or the newspaper (because I’m a thousand) as well as I ever could,
so it’s something specific to <em>screen</em> text. I have tried the obvious
things to work around it; increasing font size and using dark mode where
possible. But both options come with their own problems and annoying edge
cases. It helped. A bit.</p>
<p>Then I found a Lobsters <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ivgtpd/atkinson_hyperlegible_font">thread</a> about the <em>Atkinson Hyperlegible</em> font.
Which led me down a rabbit hole of kerning, serifs and unambiguous forms,
and a list of fonts to try.</p>
<p><img src="/images/hyper.png" alt="Hyperlegible font example"></p>
<figcaption>Atkinson Hyperlegible</figcaption>
<p>Created in partnership the Braille Institute of America, <a href="https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont">Atkinson
Hyperlegible</a> claims to differ from regular fonts by focusing on
letterform distinction. Basically it takes similar characters&ndash;think big I
and little l&ndash;and makes them visually distinct to be more readable. This
is the main one I’ve been testing recently.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fonts.png" alt="Font examples"></p>
<figcaption>Inclusive Sans (top) and B612 (bottom)</figcaption>
<p><a href="https://www.oliviaking.com/inclusive-sans">Inclusive Sans</a> is similar in that it tries to be distinct at a character
level, but without appearing out-of-place next to modern fonts. It was
also designed in Australia and has support for Aboriginal languages. Very
cool. It doesn’t scream accessibility in the way Hyperlegible does.
Perhaps that’s desirable? Keeping an eye on this one.</p>
<p>While the other two fonts were designed around accessibility, <a href="https://b612-font.com/">B612</a>, from
Airbus, was built for use on aircraft screens and dials. You don’t
want fuzzy eye-tiring text when you’re a short-sighted co-pilot on a week
long flight from Australia to&hellip;anywhere else. I feel this is the most
“normal” of the ones I’ve looked at&ndash;the letter characters nothing to
write home about, but the numbers are nicely distinctive. I can probably
find a place for it.</p>
<p>Other fonts the deserve a quick mention are <a href="https://software.sil.org/andika/">Andika</a> and the unfairly
maligned Comic Sans. Both are supposedly highly regarded by folks with
dyslexia and similar conditions. Also monospace fonts in general are
designed to offer good readability&ndash;when I do what could charitably be
called coding, I use Consolas&ndash;there are a few with the same legibility
focus as the fonts listed here, such as <a href="https://github.com/0xType/0xProto">0xProto</a>.</p>
<p>So I’m spending around a week or ten days with each font, using them in
all the easy places (word, firefox, notepad, pdfreader), and choosing
which is the most kind to my poor eyes. Then I’ll try figure out how to
use that one in all the hard places (basically the entire windows gui).</p>
<p>See you next time.</p>
