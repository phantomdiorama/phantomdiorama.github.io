<meta name="description" content="The first half of the year (now 9 months) has been eaten up with more than
usual ill health, which culminated in a night time ride in an ambulance
and a overnight stay in hospital. Thankfully, things have started to level
out enough that I can concentrate on other things.
We managed to get Frances out to some folks a few months ago and
honestly I’m find the whole beta reading thing kinda frustrating. Not
because of the lovely people who decided to take it on. They are total
sweethearts. But because it turns out I’m a very impatient person; I both
want and dread feedback. Being extra  sick and having else to focus on
hasn’t helped." />

  <p>The first half of the year (now 9 months) has been eaten up with more than
usual ill health, which culminated in a night time ride in an ambulance
and a overnight stay in hospital. Thankfully, things have started to level
out enough that I can concentrate on other things.</p>
<p>We managed to get <em>Frances</em> out to some folks a few months ago and
honestly I’m find the whole beta reading thing kinda frustrating. Not
because of the lovely people who decided to take it on. They are total
sweethearts. But because it turns out I’m a very impatient person; I both
want and dread feedback. Being extra  sick and having else to focus on
hasn’t helped.</p>
<p>And a recent visit from my datefriend has cheered me up immensely. We’re
long distance and they’re a teacher so we really only get to see each
other during the school holidays. It’s good to just be around their energy
and we got to start planning for the upcoming wedding. We’re looking at
venues and celebrants. I’ve already bought my wedding clothes including
the brightest socks in the whole world. It’s very exciting.</p>
<p>You may have noticed the site has had a redesign. I’m doing it mostly by
hand now. You will need to re-subscribe to the <a href="https://www.michaelbuckleywriter.com/blog/index.xml">feed</a>. Sorry
about that.</p>
<h2 id="reading">reading</h2>
<p>I’ve started and given up on a bunch of books the last couple months
because brain. So my <a href="reading.html">reading list</a> remains unchanged. I did pick up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heart-That-Works-Rob-Delaney-ebook/dp/B0B3TDC89Z">A
Heart That Works</a> on kindle which I hope to tackle soon.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://jenson.org/text">The invisible problem</a> on hackernews. It’s a good summary of the
issues with long-form writing on mobile. Although  the proposed solution
looks overly engineered and the extra keyboard row with nav keys in
<a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a>, seems to me like a better, simpler option. It has fixed 93% of
my issues.</p>
<h2 id="watching">watching</h2>
<p>Futurama is back, baby. And the new season is as good as the previous one.
Take that as you wish. Neighbours is also back. Which a ridiculous thing
to be happy about, but it has been a comfort show for a long time.</p>
<p>Recently saw Turning Red which was very fun and features the scariest note
you can be passed in class. IYKYK. It’s also a children’s movie featuring
two alive parents! I have been lax with Disney/Pixar so I’ve made a list
of what I haven’t seen. And then Ciel rearranged it into <em>proper</em> order
and marked the ones that are too emotional to watch without them with a
little star.</p>
