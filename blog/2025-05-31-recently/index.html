  <p>Last month was our first wedding anniversary. I think I speak for the both of us when I
say loving each other has been the easiest and best thing we&rsquo;ve ever done. It has
certainly improved my life no end, and has softened life&rsquo;s blows. And if you&rsquo;ve been
following you know we&rsquo;ve been walloped. Removing the IVF section from the now page just
now was brutal.</p>
<p>But we are ok.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still writing. And Ciel is still working. Still waiting on a sunny day.</p>
<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>
<p>Not much since last time. Finished off the thirteenth Doctor, and been dipping into
Abbott Elementary. It&rsquo;s not bad and I can&rsquo;t think of another sitcom with a primary
school setting, but the mockumentary style honestly adds very little.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tend to read much fiction when I&rsquo;m writing fiction. Which is probably a mistake.
I do enjoy a good long form article though and I think both <a href="https://vkc.sh/quit-search/">I Quit Search Engines For
Three Months</a> and <a href="https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a61536364/one-friend-in-one-month/">I Gave Myself A Month To Make One New
Friend</a> are both
worth your time.</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other Things</h2>
<p>Braille Institute of America has updated their <em>Hyperlegible</em> font. Being a nerd for
<a href="https://www.michaelbuckleywriter.com/blog/2024-08-18-fox/">such things</a>, I’m looking
forward to trying it and especially the new monospace variant. In my travels I also
discovered <a href="https://luciole-vision.com/">Luciole</a>, which shares a similar focus, and
<a href="https://github.com/subframe7536/Maple-font">Maple</a>, a monospaced font with a lovely
single-story <em>a</em>.</p>
