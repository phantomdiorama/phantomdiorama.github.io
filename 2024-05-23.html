<p>An announcement and an apology.</p>
<p>Last month I got married. Surprisingly, given who I am as a person I
was not anxious on the day, even when there was worry it would rain. I
almost burst into hot tears the moment I saw Ceil in their dress and
then again in the car, but I managed to keep it together for the
ceremony. I was completely calm saying those words in front of people.
It was a amazing day and even though it was overcast the gardens where
we had ceremony were stunning. If you follow me on social media you will
have already been bombarded with photos. And videos. Ciel has
wonderfully documented the whole thing on <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/@TaciturnMiss">Youtube</a>. Needless to
say but I’m saying it anyway, we are disgustingly happy and looking
forward to many, many adventures together.</p>
<p>To anyone looking for a boyfriend, girlfriend, best friend and/or
someone to marry, I am sorry. I got the best one. I don’t know
<em>how</em> I did it. Or why I am so lucky. But I did it. And I plan on
keeping them. So you’ll just have to make do.</p>
