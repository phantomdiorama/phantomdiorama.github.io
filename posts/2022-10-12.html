<p>Writing with another person can be a wonderful experience. Turns out
that’s even more true when you’re actually sitting beside your
co-author. And not just because they smell nice. I’m writing with my
fiancé so that last part isn’t weird.</p>
<p>So far most of the work on our novel has been done over the internet,
over distance, and asynchronously—each working when our brains felt
capable. And that hasn’t been hard. The majority of our relationship
happens over long distance so we’re used to that. And adding writing to
that wasn’t too much of an ask. Actually, I was unsure how working in
the same room would go. But sitting at the <a
href="https://twitter.com/agapanthusfran/status/1573859543570063361?s=46&amp;t=UhzpzscVeTj-_yvdnctvFw">same
desk</a> and being able to simply point at things bought back the bounce
and flow and <em>fun</em> that I didn’t realise had dissipated lately.
So we’re excited again and the soft deadline of Christmas (2022) seems
accomplishable (it’s a word).</p>
<p>Other than writing, I’ve been working a couple smaller projects. Over
the last little while I’ve been putting together a <a
href="https://github.com/phantomdiorama/writingvim">collection of
links</a> for using Vim for fiction slash general prose. I’m hoping it
will be a useful resource for beginners, like me, or at least
<em>someone</em>. This is part of my ongoing wrangling with that text
editor. And because collecting links will be an continuing thing, I’ve
made work for Future Mike which I’m sure he’ll be happy about.
Relatedly, I’ve been poking at a colorscheme for Vim inspired by Bob’s
Burgers palette. It’s called <a
href="https://github.com/phantomdiorama/nopesto">No Pesto</a>. For
obvious reasons. This was harder than I expected. For a task many people
have completed there’s a baffling lack of detailed docs. I’m letting
this be perpetually work-in-progress.</p>

<p>I got burnt out on <em>Ripley Underground</em> and needed something
different. And like the saying goes the opposite of Patricia Highsmith
is Rick Riordan. So I’ve been making my way through the Percy Jackson
series. I’m about halfway through book two, <em>The Sea of
Monsters</em>, and I’m enjoying it. The series is in first-person which
doesn’t always gel with me but Percy isn’t <em>too</em> annoying. Also
got the just-released <em>A Kind of Magic</em> by Anna Spargo-Ryan. But
it will sit on the stack until I’m emotionally ready for it.</p>
<h2 id="watching">watching</h2>
<p>I think <em>No Time to Die</em> is probably the best of the Craig
Bonds. It was more emotional than usual for a Bond but it was genuine
and wasn’t out of place. Kinda hoping it’s the end of <em>serious</em>
Bond for now though and they bring back some Roger Moore style wackiness
with the next guy. Also saw <em>Coco</em> which is a bit darker
(spoiler- there is a murder) than most Pixar fare. I loved it.</p>
<h2 id="listening">listening</h2>
<p>Almost caught up on my backlog of Richard Herring’s podcast. Just
finished the one with Omid Djalili. It’s light and funny and inoffensive
(to the ears) when I’m doing something else. And, because I’m writing
more, and I’m a big nerd, that means <em>Thelonious Monk Alone in San
Francisco</em> on repeat. Did you know his middle name was Sphere?</p>
