<p>2024-02-07</p>
<p>So far this year has been taken up with planning for the upcoming
wedding. It’s a lovely thing to be busy with, however it has left little
brain–space for anything else. Writing—both <em>real</em> and this
blog—have taken the backseat. Which is fine. But I’m looking forward to
getting back into it now most things have settled into place.</p>
<p>There is a lot of work to be done on The Book: Copy–editing to do.
Scenes to add or rewrite. We’ve found a new character who is demanding
to be included. This written–during–pandemic book is taking up <em>a
lot</em> of the post–pandemic.</p>
<p>We will get there.</p>

<p>Reading is the hobby I’ve been neglecting the most. My TBR list is so
long the screensaver on my kindle is now the disappointed face of my
mother.</p>

<p>Somehow I’ve been watching a lot of Basketball on Sundays. I don’t
know if I’d say I’m super into it, and I don’t follow a specific team,
but it’s nice to have the anticipation for it during the week. It’s easy
to forget that’s how it was for all television—waiting a week for the
next episode of Friends or The X-Files.</p>
