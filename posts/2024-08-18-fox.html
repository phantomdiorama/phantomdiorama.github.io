<p>My eyes aren’t what they used to be. A bog witch hasn’t turned them
into tiny owls–they are still eyes. But they are becoming less good at
<em>being</em> eyes.</p>
<p>Glasses may be in my future, but for now the issue is text. I can
read books or the newspaper (because I’m a thousand) as well as I ever
could, so it’s something specific to <em>screen</em> text. I have tried
the obvious things to work around it; increasing font size and using
dark mode where possible. But both options come with their own problems
and annoying edge cases. It helped. A bit.</p>
<p>Then I found a Lobsters <a
href="https://lobste.rs/s/ivgtpd/atkinson_hyperlegible_font">thread</a>
about the <em>Atkinson Hyperlegible</em> font. Which led me down a
rabbit hole of kerning, serifs and unambiguous forms, and a list of
fonts to try.</p>

<p>Created in partnership the Braille Institute of America, <a
href="https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a>
claims to differ from regular fonts by focusing on letterform
distinction. Basically it takes similar characters–think big I and
little l–and makes them visually distinct to be more readable. This is
the main one I’ve been testing recently.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.oliviaking.com/inclusive-sans">Inclusive
Sans</a> is similar in that it tries to be distinct at a character
level, but without appearing out-of-place next to modern fonts. It was
also designed in Australia and has support for Aboriginal languages.
Very cool. It doesn’t scream accessibility in the way Hyperlegible does.
Perhaps that’s desirable? Keeping an eye on this one.</p>
<p>While the other two fonts were designed around accessibility, <a
href="https://b612-font.com/">B612</a>, from Airbus, was built for use
on aircraft screens and dials. You don’t want fuzzy eye-tiring text when
you’re a short-sighted co-pilot on a week long flight from Australia
to…anywhere else. I feel this is the most “normal” of the ones I’ve
looked at–the letter characters nothing to write home about, but the
numbers are nicely distinctive. I can probably find a place for it.</p>
<p>Other fonts the deserve a quick mention are <a
href="https://software.sil.org/andika/">Andika</a> and the unfairly
maligned Comic Sans. Both are supposedly highly regarded by folks with
dyslexia and similar conditions. Also monospace fonts in general are
designed to offer good readability–when I do what could charitably be
called coding, I use Consolas–there are a few with the same legibility
focus as the fonts listed here, such as <a
href="https://github.com/0xType/0xProto">0xProto</a>.</p>
<p>So I’m spending around a week or ten days with each font, using them
in all the easy places (word, firefox, notepad, pdfreader), and choosing
which is the most kind to my poor eyes. Then I’ll try figure out how to
use that one in all the hard places (basically the entire windows
gui).</p>
<p>See you next time.</p>
