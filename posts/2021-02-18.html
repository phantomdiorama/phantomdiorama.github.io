<p>2021-02-18</p>
<p>So the experiment failed. Sort of. <a href="2021-01-03.html">Last
time</a> I talked about changing to vim in an effort to save my hands.
Text entry of course ended up the same and I could keep hitting my
(paltry) word counts. But when editing, well, there are too many
commands to hold in my head, and most of my editing time was spent
consulting the cheat sheet on my desk. Editing became wading through
sticky molasses. Had I stuck with it perhaps this need would lessen over
time. Also, I kept falling back on using the mouse which is very much
frowned on in vim circles. BUT it turns out my hands <em>require</em>
the relief that comes with stopping and moving to the electric
rodent.</p>
<p>It was not all wasted effort though. The separation of writing and
editing into distinct contexts is something I plan to continue in
future. And learning <a

will be invaluable when doing a complicated search and replace task.</p>
<p>Other parts of last month’s change-up have been more successful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/phantomdiorama/unsuckykeys">unsucky
keys</a>, the no-chording script I wrote is still in everyday use. There
are bugs and edge-cases, but it works well and stable enough to stay out
of the way</li>
<li>Changing keyboards was the main positive this past month. The one I
found in the drawer was a non-starter. Literally. The keys didn’t work.
So, I purchased a Raspberry Pi keyboard and it’s become my daily driver.
It’s sturdy for the price, has a USB hub, and the money goes to support
the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/about">Raspberry Pi
Foundation</a>. I had to remap a couple keys to make my hands happy, but
it has made a genuinely big difference to comfort and pains levels.</li>
