<p>The first half of the year (now 9 months) has been eaten up with more
than usual ill health, which culminated in a night time ride in an
ambulance and a overnight stay in hospital. Thankfully, things have
started to level out enough that I can concentrate on other things.</p>
<p>We managed to get <em>Frances</em> out to some folks a few months ago
and honestly I’m find the whole beta reading thing kinda frustrating.
Not because of the lovely people who decided to take it on. They are
total sweethearts. But because it turns out I’m a very impatient person;
I both want and dread feedback. Being extra sick and having else to
focus on hasn’t helped.</p>
<p>And a recent visit from my datefriend has cheered me up immensely.
We’re long distance and they’re a teacher so we really only get to see
each other during the school holidays. It’s good to just be around their
energy and we got to start planning for the upcoming wedding. We’re
looking at venues and celebrants. I’ve already bought my wedding clothes
including the brightest socks in the whole world. It’s very
exciting.</p>
<p>You may have noticed the site has had a redesign. I’m doing it mostly
by hand now, You will need to re-subscribe to the <a
href="atom.xml">feed</a>. Sorry about that.</p>

<p>I’ve started and given up on a bunch of books the last couple months
because brain. So my <a href="reading.html">reading list</a> remains
unchanged. I did pick up <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Heart-That-Works-Rob-Delaney-ebook/dp/B0B3TDC89Z">A
Heart That Works</a> on kindle which I hope to tackle soon.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://jenson.org/text">The invisible problem</a>
on hackernews. It’s a good summary of the issues with long-form writing
on mobile. Although the proposed solution looks overly engineered and
the extra keyboard row with nav keys in <a
href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a>, seems to me like a better,
simpler option. It has fixed 93% of my issues.</p>

<p>Futurama is back, baby. And the new season is as good as the previous
one. Take that as you wish. Neighbours is also back. Which a ridiculous
thing to be happy about, but it has been a comfort show for a long
time.</p>
<p>Recently saw Turning Red which was very fun and features the scariest
note you can be passed in class. IYKYK. It’s also a children’s movie
featuring two alive parents! I have been lax with Disney/Pixar so I’ve
made a list of what I haven’t seen. And then Ciel rearranged it into
<em>proper</em> order and marked the ones that are too emotional to
watch without them with a little star.</p>
