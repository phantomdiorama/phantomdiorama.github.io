<p>My blog setup is super minimal. It’s just a single script that wraps
around Pandoc. Ok there’s a second script that does some pre checks. But
that’s it. I call this setup <a
href="https://github.com/phantomdiorama/codnap">codnap</a>. That’s
Pandoc backwards. The github repo needed a name, ok?</p>
<p>Obviously, it’s not as automated as actual Static Site Generators
like Jekyll or Hugo, but it is simpler, more flexible and allows me to
keep all my blogging bits and pieces—markdown, images, css,
everything—in a single folder instead of a thicket of sub-directories.
This folder is called <code>blog</code> and is kept in Dropbox for easy
backup and sync. Building the site is just a matter of running two
scripts on that folder…</p>
<h2 id="check">check</h2>
<p>This does pre-build checks for outstanding to dos (w/ <a
href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>), outstanding
typos (w/ <a href="https://github.com/crate-ci/typos">typos</a>),
markdown issue (w/ <a
href="https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli">markdownlint</a>),
and displays any errors. On its face this sounds less <em>minimal</em>
than using the eyes attached to that face, but remember behind that face
is a skull of laziness. It’s fine.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">checking…</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="build">build</h2>
<p>This creates a folder at <code>blog/public</code> if it doesn’t exist
and copies all css and xml into it. Images—which I’ve pre-compressed—get
copied into <code>blog/public/images</code>.</p>
<p>Then the script iterates over the list of markdown files, uses Pandoc
to convert them to html, and then outputs the resulting files into
<code>blog/public</code> too.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>

<img src="../images/codnap2.png" alt="building…" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">building…</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="push">push</h2>
<p>After manually checking the links etc with Firefox, the contents of
<code>blog/public</code> gets copied into a git repo which then gets
pushed to the remote at <a
href="https://github.com/phantomdiorama/phantomdiorama.github.io">my
github</a> which does the actual web hosting (for more how this part
works see <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>).</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">wrapping up</h2>
<p>I started off saying my setup was minimal. While it’s true it
involves minimal <em>tooling</em>, there are a few areas which I could
streamline—I hand edit the atom feed, for one. And automating image
optimisation would be a nice edition. But I am loathe to change things
that (mostly) work.</p>

<p>PS Apologies for the <em>nothing to say, post your blog setup!</em>
style post. Still busy with weddings and a mysterious lurgy. Not to
mention Frances, the girl living in my computer, becoming fed up with
the lack of attention.</p>
