<meta name="description" content="About Me

I am a houseplant. Poor health necessitates being a homebody, so I spend
most of my time at home with a ham-fuelled cat, either reading, writing or
playing Animal Crossing with my datefriend.
Together we are currently writing a middle grade novel starring a disabled
12-and-a-bit-year-old heroine called Frances. She’s got a big heart and a
walking stick.
When I’m not writing, I’m drinking tea. I’ve been a tea drinker for years
and have tried every easily available style and flavour. But it
wasn’t until the plague that I really got into peppermint tea. And now
it’s my favourite." />
