      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know a little about coding. Enough to sometimes brute force a small&#xA;quality-of-life tweak into someone else‚Äôs code, or write a janky-as-heck&#xA;shell script. But not enough to build anything substantial from the ground&#xA;up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to fill this knowledge hole, I‚Äôve been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.michaelbuckleywriter.com/reading/&#34;&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; a few introductions to&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;. And while learning in the abstract is a start, I didn‚Äôt have a&#xA;project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Until my research workflow fell over and I had to spend a couple&#xA;afternoons in vim writing a replacement: a simple wrapper around Pandoc to&#xA;make archiving webpages easier. I called it Jones. Because he was into&#xA;archeology. And research is a &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of archeology. Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At the end of every week I could export a&#xA;list of everything I‚Äôve saved and drop it in Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then in the last month or so they‚Äôve disabled the export feature, so I&#xA;need to find another solution. Preferably something immune to sudden&#xA;disruption. Something under my control. Which ultimately means keeping&#xA;everything locally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Been dealing with an annoying health issue, as I always am, but despite&#xA;this things have been surprisingly busy. Ciel and I have just celebrated&#xA;our six month wedding anniversary so we‚Äôve been husbanding up a storm.&#xA;We really are killing it as a married couple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre also waist-deep in the preliminaries of IVF with the tests and the&#xA;money and the waiting and the money. We did our psychologist appointments,&#xA;which are a legal requirement here in Australia. And now everything is in&#xA;place to start sometime before the end of the year. Speaking of things I‚Äôm&#xA;mentally preparing for, I‚Äôm turning 40 in a few weeks, which is its own&#xA;bundle of brain-itches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My eyes aren&amp;rsquo;t what they used to be. A bog witch hasn&amp;rsquo;t turned them into&#xA;tiny owls&amp;ndash;they are still eyes. But they are becoming less good at &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Glasses may be in my future, but for now the issue is text. I can read&#xA;books or the newspaper (because I‚Äôm a thousand) as well as I ever could,&#xA;so it‚Äôs something specific to &lt;em&gt;screen&lt;/em&gt; text. I have tried the obvious&#xA;things to work around it; increasing font size and using dark mode where&#xA;possible. But both options come with their own problems and annoying edge&#xA;cases. It helped. A bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An announcement and an apology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last month I got married. Surprisingly, given who I am as a person I was&#xA;not anxious on the day, even when there was worry it would rain. I almost&#xA;burst into hot tears the moment I saw Ceil in their dress and then again&#xA;in the car, but I managed to keep it together for the ceremony. I was&#xA;completely calm saying those words in front of people. It was a amazing&#xA;day and even though it was overcast the gardens where we had ceremony were&#xA;stunning. If you follow me on social media you will have already been&#xA;bombarded with photos. And videos. Ciel has wonderfully documented the&#xA;whole thing on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@TaciturnMiss&#34;&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;. Needless&#xA;to say but I‚Äôm saying it anyway, we are disgustingly happy and looking&#xA;forward to many, many adventures together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So far this year has been taken up with planning for the upcoming wedding.&#xA;It‚Äôs a lovely thing to be busy with, however it has left little&#xA;brain‚Äìspace for anything else. Writing‚Äîboth &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; and this blog‚Äîhave&#xA;taken the backseat. Which is fine. But I‚Äôm looking forward to getting back&#xA;into it now most things have settled into place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of work to be done on The Book: Copy‚Äìediting to do. Scenes&#xA;to add or rewrite. We‚Äôve found a new character who is demanding to be&#xA;included. This written‚Äìduring‚Äìpandemic book is taking up &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of the&#xA;post‚Äìpandemic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A bunch of tech-bloggers, which I‚Äôm very much not, have been posting their&#xA;default applications over the past week or so. I think there was a&#xA;podcast. Anyway, I heard about it in a post by &lt;a href=&#34;https://rubenerd.com/my-default-applications/&#34;&gt;rubenerd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And here‚Äôs mine.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first half of the year (now 9 months) has been eaten up with more than&#xA;usual ill health, which culminated in a night time ride in an ambulance&#xA;and a overnight stay in hospital. Thankfully, things have started to level&#xA;out enough that I can concentrate on other things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We managed to get &lt;em&gt;Frances&lt;/em&gt; out to some folks a few months ago and&#xA;honestly I‚Äôm find the whole beta reading thing kinda frustrating. Not&#xA;because of the lovely people who decided to take it on. They are total&#xA;sweethearts. But because it turns out I‚Äôm a very impatient person; I both&#xA;want and dread feedback. Being extra  sick and having else to focus on&#xA;hasn‚Äôt helped.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last few weeks my part of the world has been submerged under&#xA;water. There‚Äôs been sandbagging and phones pinging warnings and evacuation&#xA;orders and helicopters going back and forth overhead. While our street&#xA;remained dry‚Äîthey put in a flood wall after the last major flood in the&#xA;90s but it had been untested until now‚Äîthe south side of the river wasn‚Äôt&#xA;as lucky and many homes are still under water and many others were&#xA;damaged. This has all been &lt;em&gt;not great&lt;/em&gt; for someone with an anxiety&#xA;disorder. And writing went out the window. Which was closed. Because of&#xA;the flood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing with another person can be a wonderful experience. Turns out&#xA;that‚Äôs even more true when you‚Äôre actually sitting beside your co-author.&#xA;And not just because they smell nice. I‚Äôm writing with my fianc√© so that&#xA;last part isn‚Äôt weird.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far most of the work on our novel has been done over the internet, over&#xA;distance, and asynchronously‚Äîeach working when our brains felt capable.&#xA;And that hasn‚Äôt been hard. The majority of our relationship happens over&#xA;long distance so we‚Äôre used to that. And adding writing to that wasn‚Äôt too&#xA;much of an ask.  Actually, I was unsure how working in the same room would&#xA;go. But sitting at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/agapanthusfran/status/1573859543570063361?s=46&amp;amp;t=UhzpzscVeTj-_yvdnctvFw&#34;&gt;same desk&lt;/a&gt; and being able to simply point at&#xA;things bought back the bounce and flow and &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; that I didn‚Äôt realise had&#xA;dissipated lately. So we‚Äôre excited again and the soft deadline of&#xA;Christmas (2022) seems accomplishable (it‚Äôs a word).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>In The White Room With Black Curtains (By The Station)</title>
      <link>https://www.michaelbuckleywriter.com/blog/2022-03-26-room/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about scene description while attempting to write&#xA;this book (yes that‚Äôs still happening). The question of how much scene&#xA;setting is necessary? How much is enough? What‚Äôs too much? Too little? How&#xA;many words are the difference between a scene that‚Äôs skeletal and one&#xA;that‚Äôs chonky?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;White Room Syndrome is the habit of creating a scenes that are so&#xA;under-described, so lacking detail that it could be taking place in a&#xA;featureless white-walled room in anywhere in the world. There is no sense&#xA;of place. And the characters are doing their stuff in an empty void as if&#xA;they‚Äôve walked out of the picture like Daffy Duck in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvXsuSJ-1A&#34;&gt;Duck Amuck&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;Obviously, scenes without specific, concrete locations are to be avoided&#xA;like the plague (assuming people actually avoid plagues anymore). But, as&#xA;a chronic under-writer, looking at thin scenes, it‚Äôs hard to not swing to&#xA;the other extreme when fleshing out the story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It started with a tweet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which became a discussion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then became a plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We would write a book together&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you may know, this year my friend, Ciel, and I decided to attempt to&#xA;write a novel together. Neither of us have written a novel before. And I&#xA;haven‚Äôt co-written anything before. So we thought we should write some&#xA;kind of work log in case we forget how we did this thing (or anyone ever&#xA;asks about it). Here goes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So the experiment failed. Sort of. Last time I talked about changing to&#xA;vim in an effort to save my hands. Text entry of course ended up the same&#xA;and I could keep hitting my (paltry) word counts. But when editing, well,&#xA;there are too many commands to hold in my head, and most of my editing&#xA;time was spent consulting the cheat sheet on my desk. Editing became&#xA;wading through sticky molasses. Had I stuck with it perhaps this need&#xA;would lessen over time. Also, I kept falling back on using the mouse which&#xA;is very much frowned on in vim circles. BUT it turns out my hands&#xA;&lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; the relief that comes with stopping and moving to the electric&#xA;rodent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two things that became obvious while attempting&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nanowrimo.org&#34;&gt;NanoWriMo&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. First, that procrastination&#xA;and global crisis are the most intimate of lovers and, second, my hands&#xA;are no longer capable of typing at a computer like they once were.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know, I have Muscular Dystrophy, which is a muscle&#xA;weakening condition. What this means is, among myriad other things,  my&#xA;hands have been slowly worsening over time. Think of how your hands look&#xA;when holding a gamepad, now take the pad away and imagine you can‚Äôt&#xA;straighten your fingers out. Yep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Poor health necessitates being a homebody, so I spend&#xA;most of my time at home with a ham-fuelled cat, either reading, writing or&#xA;playing Animal Crossing with my datefriend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Together we are currently writing a middle grade novel starring a disabled&#xA;12-and-a-bit-year-old heroine called Frances. She‚Äôs got a big heart and a&#xA;walking stick.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I‚Äôm not writing, I‚Äôm drinking tea. I‚Äôve been a tea drinker for years&#xA;and have tried every easily available style and flavour. But it&#xA;wasn‚Äôt until the plague that I really got into peppermint tea. And now&#xA;it‚Äôs my favourite.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
