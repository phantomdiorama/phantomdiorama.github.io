<p>I am a houseplant. Poor health necessitates being a homebody, so I
spend most of my time at home with a ham-fuelled cat, either reading,
writing or playing Animal Crossing with my datefriend.</p>
<p>Together we are currently writing a middle grade novel starring a
disabled 12-and-a-bit-year-old heroine called Frances. She’s has a big
heart and a walking stick.</p>

<p>I’m a firm believer in ease of access. In all areas of life.
Naturally, this means I’m passionate about anything and everything
<strong>accessibility</strong>. Not just in healthcare or the physical
world, although I will write about those, but also access to culture,
media representation, and respect. In the before times I wrote a couple
pieces on some of this stuff for <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-buckley">The
Guardian</a>.</p>
<p>The internet has been a great leveller. It allows almost anyone to
have access to the totality of human knowledge. It’s the <em>almost</em>
I’m interested in. The <strong>technology</strong> we use to connect to
the network, and the network itself, should be equally easy to access.
That’s why I’m such a fan of people like the The Raspberry Pi
Foundation, and so leery of Starlink and Facebook.</p>
<p>I’ve been a tea drinker for many years, and have tried every type and
style available at the supermarket. But it was during the plague that I
really got into <strong>peppermint tea</strong> and now it’s my
favourite. I’m still only at teabag level but see myself venturing into
the wild west of loose leaf.</p>
